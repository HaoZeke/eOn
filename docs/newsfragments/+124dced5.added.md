New Job handling with CRTP

### Overview

This release introduces a new, efficient way to handle different job types using a combination of the Factory Method Pattern and Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP). This approach allows for compile-time polymorphism while maintaining flexibility in job creation through a factory function.

### Key Features

1. **CRTP for Static Polymorphism**:
   - The base class `Job<T>` template uses CRTP to provide a default
     implementation of the `run` method. This allows derived job types to
     override `run` without the overhead of virtual function calls.
