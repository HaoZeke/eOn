* About
Setting this up is a major pain because of the way ~cargo~ is used within the ~cmake~ to generate all the headers. The simplest route is to actually build this into the ~CONDA_PREFIX~.

#+begin_src nushell
# For metatensor and metatensor-torch
(cmake -G Ninja
       -B build -DBUILD_METATENSOR_TORCH=ON
       -DTorch_DIR="/home/rgoswami/Git/Github/Cpp/cppShit/materials/differentiation/torchTrials/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch/"
       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$"($env.CONDA_PREFIX)")
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
# For metatomic
(cmake -G Ninja
        -B build
        -DTorch_DIR="/home/rgoswami/Git/Github/Cpp/cppShit/materials/differentiation/torchTrials/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch/"
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$"($env.CONDA_PREFIX)")
 cmake --build build
 cmake --install build
#+end_src

Additionally, ensure that the libraries are up to date..

#+begin_src bash
mamba install "gcc_linux-64>=12" "gxx_linux-64>=12" "sysroot_linux-64>=2.28"
#+end_src
