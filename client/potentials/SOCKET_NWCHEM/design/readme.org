* Design
This time around, the idea is to directly interact with ~nwchem~ without the
intermediate ~python~ layer.

Several notes are relevant about the networking protocol (specific to the implementation in ~nwchem~):
- *Must* be little endian
- *Initial* atom types and the number of atoms is used to allocate memory and cannot be changed later.
